  ## Welcome to Bhavin's Webpage

Thanks for visiting! 

At present, I am a junior Computer Science and Video Game Development student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

I am born and raised nearby in Glendale, California. My curiosity and love of learning naturally brought me to science and tech where
the pool of knowledge is so endlessly enticing.

Aside from my coursework, I am working on a video game project with the Creative Media and Behavioral Health center to enable wheelchair-bound
patients to work on shoulder rehabilitation through playing a game. This is my year-long capstone project for the 2019-2020 school year.w

Last year as a sophomore, I worked on my first ever video game project called "End of the Line" with another USC team. This was a narrative
choose-your-own adventure game built in the Unity engine.
