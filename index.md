Thanks for visiting! 

At present, I am a junior Computer Science and Video Game Development student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

My coursework includes a mix of Computer Science theory and game programming classes.

My primary work experience has been at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on ML computer vision models for driving rovers on Mars. My most
recent project was to optimize Tensorflow-based image captioning models for an embedded flight computer. Here's a <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&TaskID=343&tdaID=700138">description</a> of the overall project.

I am currently working on a video game project with the Creative Media and Behavioral Health center to enable wheelchair-bound
patients to work on shoulder rehabilitation through playing a game. This is my year-long capstone project for the 2019-2020 school year.

Last year as a sophomore, I worked on my first ever video game project called "End of the Line" with another USC team. This was a narrative
choose-your-own adventure game built in the Unity engine.
