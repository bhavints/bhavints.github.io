Thanks for visiting! 

At present, I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I am a software engineer specializing in robotics.

Here's a quick rundown of my techncial experience:
<ul>
<li>Computer Vision with Tensorflow and Python</li>
<li>C#/C++ 3D Applications in Unity and Unreal Engines</li>
<li>PHP/SQL/Java Web Services hosted on Cloud</li>
<li>Data visualization with Javascript</li>
<li>Embedded software with Arduinos</li>
<li>CAM/CNC programming and operation</li>
</ul>

My primary work experience has been at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on ML computer vision models for driving rovers on Mars. My most
recent project was to optimize Tensorflow-based image captioning models for an embedded flight computer. Here's a <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&TaskID=343&tdaID=700138">description</a> of the overall project.
