Thanks for visiting! 

At present, I am a junior Computer Science and Video Game Development student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

My coursework includes a mix of Computer Science theory and game programming classes.

I am currently working on a video game project with the Creative Media and Behavioral Health center to enable wheelchair-bound
patients to work on shoulder rehabilitation through playing a game. This is my year-long capstone project for the 2019-2020 school year.w

Last year as a sophomore, I worked on my first ever video game project called "End of the Line" with another USC team. This was a narrative
choose-your-own adventure game built in the Unity engine.
