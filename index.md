Thanks for visiting! 

At present, I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I am looking to become a robotics software engineer specializing in machine learning for perception and control.

My primary work experience has been at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on ML computer vision models for driving rovers on Mars. My most
recent project was to optimize Tensorflow-based image captioning models for an embedded flight computer. Here's a <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&TaskID=343&tdaID=700138">description</a> of the overall project.
