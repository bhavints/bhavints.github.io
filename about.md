This website serves as a record of my work and ideas. Be sure to check out the blog!

I am a native of Glendale, California where I have lived my whole life. It's a beautiful place and 
I am grateful to have grown up here.

I went to all local schools - Glenoaks, Verdugo Woodlands, Wilson Middle, and Clark Magnet High. In that time,
I've learned a lot of subjects and met wonderful people. Since graduating high school in 2017, I've moved on 
to studying Computer Science at USC.

My interests are wide, and technology is no exception. I think growing up in the 2010s shaped my career because of how
intriguing tech was to all of us. As a kid, I spent a lot of time on my laptop playing games and reading Wikipedia. I also
enjoyed my Nintendo DS, Wii, a brief stint with the PS2, and lastly the 3DS. 

Over the course of high school, I was involved in quite a few disparate interests. I was captain of my team's scholastic bowl, 
which was run by our school's head librarian. Scholastic Bowl satisfied my love of history, geography, literature (although I 
have so much reading to do), and science. Over the summers, I was extremely lucky to be admitted to a summer science program at 
Caltech where I conducted molecular dynamics simulations to understand properties relevant to battery operation. At school, I was 
the founder of a cybersecurity club where we learned about defending computers from hacking attempts. I also worked with my school's 
robotics team where I was most proud of learning how to use CNC machines to cut metal parts for our robots.

During my last year of high school and continuing to this day, I was fortunate to gain employment at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
where I have worked in several roles. For the first two years of my employment (2016-2017) I worked on a digital signage system that
allowed the lab to display posters, announcements, and other promotional material on TVs across the lab's campus. From 2018-2019, I 
have been working with the data science team on the MAARS project, an effort to use deep learning to improve the MARS rovers energy
usage and science capabilities.

At USC, I have primarily gotten involved with the Games program on several different student project teams. In my Game Prototyping
class, I worked on 240 Golf, aka "Golf with Guns," a Unity-built Windows game where players are racing to finish a golf course while shooting 
at each other in order to possess the course's sole golf ball. My contribution was developing the character animation system and bug fixing for
our prototype.

For the school year 2018-2019, I worked on End of the Line, a Unity-built Windows game where the player must solve a murder mystery by
talking with numerous characters and gleaning bits and pieces of information from each character. The end product was a 15 minute demo
that was displayed at USC's Games Expo 2019.

For the school year 2019-2020, I am working on Skyfarer, a mixed-reality shoulder rehabilitation game meant for wheelchair-bound patients.

Looking to the future, I am aiming to further refine my game programming and data science skills. Look at my blog for more insight into
what motivates me.
