<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b>
For the first two years of my employment (2016-2017) I worked on a digital signage system that
allowed the lab to display posters, announcements, and other promotional material on TVs across the lab's campus. From 2018-2020, I 
have been working with the data science team on the MAARS project, an effort to use deep learning to improve the MARS rovers energy
usage and science capabilities. 

<b> USC Games </b>
To pursue my interests in 3D computer graphics and simulation, I have worked on several research and video game projects at USC.

I am currently working a VR combat video game for the Oculus Rift / Oculus Quest as part of my final year capstone.

For the school year 2019-2020, I worked on Soulfarer, a mixed-reality shoulder rehabilitation game meant for wheelchair-bound patients.

For the school year 2018-2019, I worked on End of the Line, a Unity-built Windows game where the player must solve a murder mystery by
talking with numerous characters and gleaning bits and pieces of information from each character. The end product was a 15 minute demo
that was displayed at USC's Games Expo 2019.

I have also worked on 240 Golf, aka "Golf with Guns," a Unity-built Windows game where players are racing to finish a golf course while shooting 
at each other in order to possess the course's sole golf ball. My contribution was developing the character animation system and bug fixing for
our prototype.
