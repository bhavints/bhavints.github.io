<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b>
For the first two years of my employment (2016-2017) I worked on a digital signage system that
allowed the lab to display posters, announcements, and other promotional material on TVs across the lab's campus. From 2018-2020, I 
have been working with the data science team on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2020.104943"> MAARS project </a>, an effort to use deep learning to improve the MARS rovers energy
usage and science capabilities. 


<b> USC Department of Computer Science </b>
To pursue my interests in 3D computer graphics and simulation, I have worked on several research and video game projects at USC.

I am currently working a VR combat video game called <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F4jMRRYmfsAmkoUjMvnaUpR7SkLrMc6UGaorH0oohM4/edit?usp=sharing"> Beat the Beat Up </a> for the Oculus Rift / Oculus Quest as part of my final year capstone.

For the school year 2019-2020, I worked on Soulfarer, a mixed-reality shoulder rehabilitation game meant for wheelchair-bound patients.

For the school year 2018-2019, I worked on End of the Line, a Unity-built Windows game where the player must solve a murder mystery by
talking with numerous characters and gleaning bits and pieces of information from each character. The end product was a 15 minute demo
that was displayed at USC's Games Expo 2019.
