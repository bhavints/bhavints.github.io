<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b>
For the first two years of my employment (2016-2017) I worked on a digital signage system that
allowed the lab to display posters, announcements, and other promotional material on TVs across the lab's campus. From 2018-2020, I 
worked with the data science team on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2020.104943"> MAARS project </a>, an effort to use deep learning to improve the MARS rovers energy
usage and science capabilities. At present, I am contributing computer vision models for image classification, object detection, and image regression to an AutoML project called <a href="https://gitlab.com/datadrivendiscovery/jpl"> DARPA D3M </a>.


<b> USC Department of Computer Science </b>
To pursue my interests in 3D computer graphics and simulation, I have worked on several research and video game projects at USC.

I shipped a VR combat video game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620020/Beat_the_Beat_Up/"> Beat the Beat Up </a> for the Oculus Rift / Oculus Quest as part of my final year capstone.

For the school year 2018-2019, I worked on End of the Line, a Unity-built Windows game where the player must solve a murder mystery by
talking with numerous characters and gleaning bits and pieces of information from each character. The end product was a 15 minute demo
that was displayed at USC's Games Expo 2019.
