This blog took years to finally setup. Thank you Github pages! 

As of this post, I have complete my first semester of junior year. Over the course of this semester, I've worked
on Skyfarer, a mixed-reality shoulder rehabilitation game. A gameplay video is featured below:

The game makes use of a custom-built "rig" which you can see in the video. The rig has 8 attached exercises for a wheelchair 
patient to use. The goal of this project is to make a gamified rehab experience that allows for the patient to enjoy rehab, learn proper
technique, and successfully complete a full rehab program.
