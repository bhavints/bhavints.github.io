Looking ahead, I am taking some important classes this semester.

Native Multiplayer Console Development - Going to be working in a custom-built engine called Prime Engine to
create a game.

Intermediate Game Development - Going to work on a game start-to-finish in Unity.

Rest of the schedule to come...
